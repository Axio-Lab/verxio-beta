# Solana Pay Integration for Verxio Checkout

This document explains how the Solana Pay integration works in the Verxio checkout system.

## Overview

The checkout system now integrates Solana Pay to enable instant, secure payments using USDC on the Solana blockchain. Customers can scan QR codes with their Solana wallets to complete payments and earn loyalty points.

## Features

- **Static QR Code**: Uses existing QR code image from public folder for consistent branding
- **USDC Devnet Support**: Currently configured for Solana devnet testing
- **Loyalty Integration**: Automatically calculates and awards loyalty points
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Simulates payment confirmation for testing
- **Multi-wallet Support**: Compatible with Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, and other Solana wallets
- **Payment Link Generation**: Creates copyable Solana Pay URLs for easy sharing

## How It Works

### 1. Payment Generation
- Merchant creates a payment checkout with amount and loyalty program
- System generates a Solana Pay URL with payment details
- Static QR code image is displayed for customer scanning

### 2. Customer Payment
- Customer scans QR code with Solana wallet
- Wallet opens with pre-filled payment details
- Customer confirms USDC payment

### 3. Payment Confirmation
- System monitors for payment completion
- Loyalty points are calculated and awarded
- Success screen displays transaction details

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
```bash
@solana/web3.js      # Solana Web3 client
@solana/spl-token    # SPL token support
qrcode.react         # QR code generation (removed - using static image)
```

### Key Components

#### `SolanaPayIntegration`
- Main component handling Solana Pay flow
- Displays static QR code image
- Generates Solana Pay URLs for copying
- Manages payment states and loyalty points

#### `solana-config.ts`
- Centralized Solana configuration
- Devnet RPC endpoint and USDC mint address
- Helper functions for token operations

### QR Code Implementation

The system uses a static QR code image (`/scan_me_qr_code.svg`) located in the public folder. This approach provides:

- **Consistent Branding**: Same QR code appearance across all payments
- **Faster Loading**: No dynamic QR code generation delays
- **Simplified Code**: Removes dependency on QR code generation libraries
- **Easy Customization**: QR code can be updated by replacing the image file

### Payment URL Generation

Instead of dynamic QR codes, the system generates Solana Pay URLs that customers can copy and paste:

```
solana:11111111111111111111111111111111?amount=85.00&reference=PAY_123&label=Verxio%20Checkout&message=Thank%20you%20for%20your%20purchase!
```

## Configuration

#### Devnet Settings
```typescript
RPC_ENDPOINT: 'https://api.devnet.solana.com'
USDC_MINT: '4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU'
NETWORK_NAME: 'Solana Devnet'
```

#### Production Settings (Future)
```typescript
RPC_ENDPOINT: 'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com'
USDC_MINT: 'EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v'
NETWORK_NAME: 'Solana Mainnet'
```

## Testing

### Devnet Testing
1. **Manual Payment**: Click "üß™ Test Payment (Devnet)" button
2. **Auto-completion**: Payment auto-completes after 20 seconds
3. **Console Logs**: Check browser console for loyalty point calculations

### Console Output Example
```
üéâ Payment successful! Customer earned 85 loyalty points
üí∞ Amount paid: $85.00 USDC
üèÜ Loyalty tier: Gold Member
üì± Payment ID: PAY_1234567890
üîó Network: Solana Devnet
```

## Loyalty Points System

### Calculation
- **Base Points**: 1 point per $1 spent
- **Tier Discounts**: Applied before point calculation
- **Example**: $100 purchase with 15% Gold discount = 85 points

### Loyalty Tiers
- **Gold**: 15% discount
- **Silver**: 10% discount  
- **Bronze**: 5% discount

## Future Enhancements

### Production Features
- [ ] Real Solana mainnet integration
- [ ] Webhook payment confirmations
- [ ] Transaction signature verification
- [ ] Multi-token support (SOL, USDT, etc.)
- [ ] Merchant wallet management
- [ ] Dynamic QR code generation with real payment data

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Recurring payments
- [ ] Split payments

## Security Considerations

### Current (Devnet)
- Mock merchant wallet for testing
- Simulated payment confirmations
- No real blockchain transactions
- Static QR code (not payment-specific)

### Production
- Secure merchant wallet management
- Transaction signature verification
- Webhook security validation
- Rate limiting and fraud detection
- Dynamic QR codes with real payment data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **QR Code Not Displaying**
   - Check if `/scan_me_qr_code.svg` exists in public folder
   - Verify image path and permissions
   - Check browser console for image loading errors

2. **Payment Not Confirming**
   - Ensure devnet RPC is accessible
   - Check payment monitoring logic
   - Verify loyalty point calculations

3. **Loyalty Points Not Awarded**
   - Check payment completion callback
   - Verify point calculation logic
   - Check console logs for errors

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by checking browser console for:
- Payment URL generation
- Payment status changes
- Loyalty point calculations

## Getting Help

For technical support or questions about the Solana Pay integration:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Solana devnet connectivity
3. Review loyalty point calculations
4. Test with manual payment button
5. Ensure QR code image is accessible
